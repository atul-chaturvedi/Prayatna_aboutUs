The main motive is to give them the basic knowledge about computers. The members go to nearby villages and tell them about computers and its usage through clips, animation etc. they teach them some basics regarding computers, hardware parts,ms-word, flash games, paint brush, calculator etc. . Games and other sort of competitions are also conducted among rural children and are awarded as per their performance.
